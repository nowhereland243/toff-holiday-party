## 01. Who

Tom of Finland Foundation, founded in 1984, holds the largest collection of Tom of Finland drawings, and safeguards the world's largest collection of queer and erotic art—including over 1,800 of Tom's original works, thousands of photographs, letters, and archival materials. For over 40 years, we've nurtured artists, hosted one of the longest-running Queer residencies, and brought exhibitions to audiences from Los Angeles to Helsinki, and Paris, Berlin and London

## 02. Why

**Why We Gather**

On December 11th, we descend upon APPARATUS in Chelsea to celebrate resilience. But this is more than an affair; it is an act of stewardship.

For fourty-one  years,Tom of Finland Foundation has stood as a guardian against erasure. We are not just preserving drawings; we are protecting a culture. We are a museum, library and research center, archive, a home, and a global hub for Queer expression.

**Our Mission is Absolute**

We steward the legacy of Tom of Finland so that freedom of expression remains, sexual and Queer liberation expands, and global Queer futures thrive. We protect Queer and Queer art. We Queer the canon. We nurture artists. We foster belonging. We strengthen Queer lives.

## 03. What

Your contribution sustains four critical pillars of action.

**I. Nurturing Artists: The Residency**

We invite artists to live at TOM House in Los Angeles for three-months cycles. Our Artist-in-Residence Program provides the ultimate luxury to QTBIPOC artists: inspiration and safe space.

**II. Protecting Art: The Archives**

We maintain the world's largest known collections  of erotic art and ephemera. This is our defense against censorship in a time where our history is more important than ever.

**III. Strengthening Grounds: Research**

We refuse to let our history be forgotten or our psychology be pathologized. We aim to support research in:

- **Queer History**: We document and archive the lineages of our community to ensure our stories are canonized in history books rather than erased.

- **Queer Culture**: We support exhibitions and publications that celebrate the nuances of our lifestyle as essential cultural heritage.

- **Queer Psychology**: We fund research into the positive mental health impacts of sexual expression and community belonging to combat stigma with science.

- **Queer Sexuality**: We preserve the artifacts and history of leather and kink, framing these practices as vital expressions of human intimacy and trust.

- **Queer Art Preservation**: We provide the technical stewardship to restore and protect aging erotic artworks, ensuring they survive for future generations.

- **Queer Art Community Engagement**: We foster belonging through life drawing classes, workshops, and salons that create safe spaces for shared creative expression.

**IV. Global Stage: Public Programming**

We bring the fight for Queer liberation to a global stage. From our headquarters in Los Angeles to our recent collaboration with Berghain in Berlin, we transform spaces into hubs of education and artistic  resistance.
